Trial of some ideas for Pack your bags

As I was thinking about doing an itinerary I wanted to manage users 
and trips. I wrote this prototype to think about that. 

After the itinerary MVP is done, it may be useful to look at this.
This prototype could be used for users/administrators to 
manage trips for people in an office personal and business.

I have implemented a couple of APIs that we can look at.
